MODLE1-MobileNetV2(keras):
    A lightweight, fast CNN
    Pretrained on ImageNet
    Good for small datasets and real-time applications
 
MODEL2-ResNet50
    A deep residual network
    Pretrained on ImageNet
    High accuracy, deeper architecture
    Suitable for more powerful systems or larger datasets

MODEL3-EfficientNetB0
    Pretrained model
    State-of-the-art model balancing speed and accuracy
    Very efficient in parameter usage
    Scalable to larger versions (B1â€“B7)

MODEL4-Custom CNN (Best)
    A simple Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch
    Great for learning and fast experimentation
    Added an `Input()` layer to avoid warnings
    Fine-tuned versions of the above models
    Output layer: `Dense(3, activation='softmax')`

MODEL5-Custom CNN with BatchNormalization
    A simple Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch with Normalization
    Generalizes the model
